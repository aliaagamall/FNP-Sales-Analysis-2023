## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from Ferns and Petals (FNP), a company specializing in gifts for occasions like Diwali, Raksha Bandhan, Holi, Valentine's Day, Birthdays, and Anniversaries. The analysis uses Excel to clean data, create calculations, build a data model, and generate insights on sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. The goal is to help FNP improve sales strategies and customer satisfaction.

## Data Sources
